                <strong>Summary</strong> <p>
                    By downloading or using any of our games, these terms will
                    automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
                    that you read them carefully before downloading. You’re
                    not allowed to copy, or modify, any part of the games,
                    or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt
                    to extract the source code of our games, and you also
                    shouldn’t try to translate the games into other languages, or
                    make derivative versions. Our games, and all the trade
                    marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual
                    property rights related to them, still belong to
                    GGEZ GAMES.
                  </p> <p>
                    Our games store and process personal data
                    that you have provided to us, in order to provide
                    our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your
                    phone and access to the games secure. We therefore recommend
                    that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the
                    process of removing software restrictions and limitations
                    imposed by the official operating system of your device. It
                    could make your phone vulnerable to
                    malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
                    security features and it could mean that our
                    games won’t work properly or at all.
                  </p> <p>
                    You should be aware that there are certain things that
                    GGEZ GAMES will not take responsibility for.
                    Certain functions of our games will require you to have an
                    active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or
                    provided by your mobile network provider, but
                    GGEZ GAMES cannot take responsibility for our
                    games not working at full functionality if you don’t have
                    access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data
                    allowance left.
                  </p> <p></p> <p>
                    If you’re using the games outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                    should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                    mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you
                    may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data
                    for the duration of the connection while accessing the games,
                    or other third party charges. By using our games, you’re
                    accepting responsibility for any such charges, including
                    roaming data charges if you play the games outside of your home
                    territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
                    roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
                    which you’re using the games, please be aware that we assume
                    that you have received permission from the bill payer for
                    using the games.
                  </p> <p>
                    Along the same lines, GGEZ GAMES cannot always
                    take responsibility for the way you play the games i.e. You
                    need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it
                    runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the
                    Service, GGEZ GAMES cannot accept
                    responsibility.
                  </p> <p>
                    With respect to GGEZ GAMES’s responsibility for
                    your use of our games, when you’re using the games, it’s
                    important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to
                    ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do
                    rely on third parties to provide information to us so that
                    we can make it available to you.
                    GGEZ GAMES accepts no liability for any loss,
                    direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying
                    wholly on this functionality of the games.
                  </p> <p>
                    At some point, we may wish to update the games. The games are
                    currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for
                    both systems (and for any additional systems we
                    decide to extend the availability of the games to) may change,
                    and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                    using the games. GGEZ GAMES does not promise that
                    it will always update the games so that it is relevant to you
                    and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
                    installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                    accept updates to the games when offered to you, We
                    may also wish to stop providing the games, and may terminate
                    use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
                    to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination,
                    (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms
                    will end; (b) you must stop using the games, and (if needed)
                    delete it from your device.
                  </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p>
                    We may update our Terms and Conditions
                    from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
                    periodically for any changes. We will
                    notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
                    Conditions on this page. These changes are effective
                    immediately after they are posted on this page.
