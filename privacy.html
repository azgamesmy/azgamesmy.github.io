<p></p>
<p><strong>[ Voodoo apps and games ] </strong></p>
<p><strong> Why does Voodoo collect data from its apps and games? </strong></p>
<p>When you use the Voodoo Apps and Games, We will collect information about you. Such information, also known as &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; can be automatically collected by Voodoo when necessary, or voluntary submitted by you. We use this data to provide you with the app or game that you downloaded, to ensure safety, and for other purposes described below.</p>
<p>When you install and use Voodoo Apps and Games, we can collect and process some of your data for different legitimate purposes.</p>
<p>You will find below explanations regarding the reasons why Voodoo may collect data and the legal bases Voodoo relies on in each case.</p>
<p>Voodoo collects data:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To provide you with the services you asked for (e.g., knowing that you completed the first level to allow access to the second one)</li>
	<li>Legal basis &ndash; Voodoo&rsquo;s legitimate intererest : such data processing is strictly necessary for the service(s) asked</li>
	<li>To run analytics and understand how users interact with our product and services in order to continuously improve it either directly or through third party partners (e.g. identifying that a feature is annoying for users or that a level is too difficult for most gamers)</li>
	<li>Legal basis for third party analytics - Express consent. In the countries where collecting users&rsquo; consent may be required by applicable laws and regulations, Voodoo only shares personal data collected through Voodoo apps with third party partners that provide Voodoo with analytics services once you express your consent through the pop-up notice included in our apps.</li>
	<li>Legal basis for first party analytics &ndash; Legitimate interest. Voodoo collects user data for the purpose of its own internal analytics tools. Data is used for the sole purpose of Voodoo analytics tool and is not shared with any third parties. This data processing is based on the legitimate interest of Voodoo.</li>
	<li>To serve advertising tailored to the preference and interests of our users</li>
	<li>and allow Voodoo to continue to provide free services and products</li>
	<li>Legal basis &ndash; Express consent. In the countries where collecting users&rsquo; consent may be required by applicable laws and regulations, Voodoo only processes or shares personal data collected through Voodoo apps for personalized advertising purposes once you express your consent through the pop-up notice included in one of our apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>For all data processing activities that rely on users&rsquo; consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time from the &ldquo;settings&rdquo; page in our various applications.</p>
<p>Please only note that in the case where you withdraw your consent or where you refuse to consent in the first place, you will still be served with advertising but that may be less relevant to you as it will not be tailored to your interests.</p>
<p><strong> What data does Voodoo collect from its apps and games? </strong></p>
<p>Voodoo does not use any data that allows us to identify you directly. We only collect mobile identifiers and other technical information (if necessary, only with your consent) allowing us to recognize your device.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The apps you are using</li>

	<li>Information about the device you use and your connection (user agent, type of connection, timestamp, system language, device model, screen resolution and settings, battery level, available storage space, time zone, OS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Data pertaining to your activities on our applications and notably the way in which you interact with our applications (for instance, how and when you use our applications) and with the advertising served in our applications (for instance, number of ads served, potential clicks)</p>
<p><strong> With whom may your data be shared &amp; why? </strong></p>

<p>Voodoo does not share your personal data with third parties without your prior consent in the countries where collecting users&rsquo; consent may be required by applicable laws and regulations.</p>
